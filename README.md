## What is Elide?

Elide is a new runtime and framework designed for the polyglot era. Mix and match languages including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and JVM, with the ability to share objects between them. It's fast: Elide can execute Python at up to 3x the speed of CPython, Ruby at up to 22x vs. CRuby, and JavaScript at up to 75x the speed of Node. Elide already beats Node, Deno, and Bun under benchmark.
